Here's a detailed explanation of each topic related to ASP.NET Core 8.0 and Razor Pages, along with examples in C#:

### 1. Razor Syntax
Razor is a markup syntax for embedding server-based code into webpages. It provides a compact syntax for writing HTML and C# code together. Razor syntax begins with the `@` symbol and is simple to use.

Example:
```csharp
@{
    var title = "Hello World";
}
<h1>@title</h1>
```

### 2. Mixing C# and HTML
Razor syntax allows you to mix C# code with HTML seamlessly. You can write loops, conditions, and any C# code inside Razor views.

Example:
```csharp
@for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    <p>Item @i</p>
}
```

### 3. Razor Expressions and Code Blocks
- **Razor Expressions**: These are used to output the value of C# code, e.g., `@DateTime.Now`.
- **Code Blocks**: These allow you to write more complex logic, enclosed in `@{}`.

Example:
```csharp
@{
    var currentTime = DateTime.Now;
}
<p>Current Time: @currentTime</p>
```

### 4. Layout Pages and Sections
Layout pages are used to define a common structure for multiple pages (e.g., headers, footers). Sections allow you to define placeholders in layouts that can be overridden in content pages.

Example:
_Layout.cshtml:
```csharp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>@ViewData["Title"]</title>
</head>
<body>
    @RenderBody()
    @RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)
</body>
</html>
```

Index.cshtml:
```csharp
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}
@section Scripts {
    <script src="myscript.js"></script>
}
<h1>Welcome to Razor Pages!</h1>
```

### 5. Page Models and View Components
- **Page Models**: C# classes associated with Razor Pages to handle requests.
- **View Components**: Reusable components that encapsulate rendering logic, similar to partial views but more powerful.

Example of Page Model:
```csharp
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    public void OnGet()
    {
        // Handling GET requests
    }
}
```

### 6. Creating and Using Page Models
Page Models are typically created by adding a `.cshtml.cs` file alongside a `.cshtml` Razor Page. They handle the logic for the page.

Example:
`Index.cshtml.cs`:
```csharp
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    public string Message { get; set; }

    public void OnGet()
    {
        Message = "Hello from Page Model!";
    }
}
```

### 7. Dependency Injection in Page Models
ASP.NET Core supports Dependency Injection (DI) out of the box. You can inject services like `ILogger` into Page Models via the constructor.

Example:
```csharp
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly ILogger<IndexModel> _logger;

    public IndexModel(ILogger<IndexModel> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void OnGet()
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Index page accessed.");
    }
}
```

### 8. View Components for Reusable UI Parts
View Components are like partial views but come with a dedicated C# class and offer more flexibility. They are used for rendering reusable parts of UI.

Example:
```csharp
public class RecentPostsViewComponent : ViewComponent
{
    public IViewComponentResult Invoke()
    {
        return View("Default", GetRecentPosts());
    }

    private List<string> GetRecentPosts()
    {
        return new List<string> { "Post1", "Post2", "Post3" };
    }
}
```

### 9. Routing in Razor Pages
Routing in Razor Pages is based on the folder and file structure. Pages can be accessed via URLs that map to their locations in the `Pages` folder.

### 10. Conventional Routing
Conventional routing defines URL patterns that map to controllers and actions. It's more common in MVC applications, but Razor Pages also support it.

### 11. Attribute Routing
Attribute routing uses attributes to define routes directly on controllers or Razor Pages. It provides more control over routing.

Example:
```csharp
[Route("MyPage/{id?}")]
public IActionResult MyPage(int? id)
{
    // Your logic here
}
```

### 12. Route Constraints and Parameters
Constraints are rules that routes must follow to be matched. Parameters allow dynamic values in URLs.

Example:
```csharp
[Route("products/{id:int:min(1)}")]
public IActionResult Product(int id)
{
    // Product logic
}
```

### 13. Forms and Model Binding
Model Binding is the process of converting form data into .NET objects. Razor Pages make model binding simple by mapping form data to properties on Page Models.

### 14. Creating Forms in Razor Pages
Forms are created using HTML form tags with Razor syntax for binding and submitting data.

Example:
```csharp
<form method="post">
    <input type="text" asp-for="UserName" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### 15. Model Binding to Page Model Properties
Model binding maps form data to properties on Page Models, making data handling straightforward.

### 16. Handling Form Submission
Form submission is handled using HTTP methods like `POST`. In Razor Pages, use methods like `OnPost` to handle form submissions.

Example:
```csharp
public void OnPost()
{
    // Handle form submission
}
```

### 17. Hands-On: Create a Simple CRUD Application for a "Todo" List

#### 18. Designing the Todo Model
Create a `Todo` model class.
```csharp
public class Todo
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public bool IsCompleted { get; set; }
}
```

#### 19. Implementing Pages for Listing, Creating, Editing, and Deleting Todos
Create Razor Pages for each CRUD operation: List, Create, Edit, Delete.

#### 20. Using Forms and Model Binding for Data Input
Forms are used in `Create` and `Edit` pages, and model binding is utilized to bind form data to the `Todo` model.
