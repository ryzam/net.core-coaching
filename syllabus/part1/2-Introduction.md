  - C# 3.0 (2007): LINQ, lambda expressions, extension methods
  - C# 4.0 (2010): Dynamic binding, named/optional parameters
  - C# 5.0 (2012): Async/await pattern
  - C# 6.0 (2015): String interpolation, null-conditional operators
  - C# 7.0-7.3 (2017-2018): Tuples, pattern matching, local functions
  - C# 8.0 (2019): Nullable reference types, async streams
  - C# 9.0 (2020): Records, init-only setters, top-level statements
  - C# 10.0 (2021): Global using directives, file-scoped namespaces
  - C# 11.0 (2022): Raw string literals, required members

### .NET Evolution
- .NET Framework 1.0 released in 2002.
- Evolved through versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8.
- .NET Core introduced in 2016 as a cross-platform, open-source framework.
- .NET 5 released in 2020, unifying .NET Framework and .NET Core.
- .NET 6 (2021) and .NET 7 (2022) continue the unified platform.

## .NET Standard vs .NET Core vs .NET Framework

### .NET Framework
- The original implementation of .NET.
- Windows-only, not open-source.
- Includes WPF, Windows Forms, and ASP.NET Web Forms.
- No longer receiving major updates (last version: 4.8).

### .NET Core
- Cross-platform, open-source reimplementation of .NET.
- High performance and scalability.
- Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Ideal for cloud and microservices architectures.
- Evolved into .NET 5+ (dropping "Core" from the name).

### .NET Standard
- A specification of .NET APIs that are available on all .NET implementations.
- Ensures compatibility across different .NET versions.
- Replaced by .NET 5+ as the unification point for all .NET platforms.

#### **Overview of .NET Core and C# **

1. **Introduction to .NET Core**
   - .NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source framework developed by Microsoft for building modern applications.
   - Supports development for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   - .NET Core is part of the .NET ecosystem, which includes .NET Framework, Xamarin, and .NET Standard.
   - Key components of .NET Core:
     - **CoreCLR**: The runtime that handles memory management, garbage collection, and compilation.
     - **CoreFX**: The foundational libraries that provide APIs for application development.
     - **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**: Tools for building and running .NET Core applications from the terminal.
   - Advantages of .NET Core:
     - Cross-platform support
     - High performance and scalability
     - Modular and lightweight
     - Support for microservices and Docker

2. **Introduction to C#**
   - C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.
   - Designed for building a variety of applications, from desktop and web to mobile and cloud.
   - Key features of C#:
     - Strongly typed and statically compiled
     - Supports object-oriented, component-oriented, and functional programming paradigms
     - Rich standard library and LINQ (Language Integrated Query) support
   - Comparison with other languages like Java and Python.

#### **Setting Up the Development Environment (Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code) (45 minutes)**

1. **Choosing the Development Environment**
   - **Visual Studio**: A full-featured Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for .NET development. Available in Community (free), Professional, and Enterprise editions.
   - **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A lightweight, open-source code editor that supports multiple languages and has excellent extensions for .NET Core development.

2. **Installing .NET Core SDK and Runtime**
   - Download the .NET Core SDK from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
   - Install the SDK, which includes the .NET CLI tools, runtime, and libraries needed for building .NET Core applications.

3. **Installing Visual Studio**
   - Download Visual Studio from the official [Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
   - Choose the "ASP.NET and web development" workload during installation to get the necessary tools for C# and .NET Core development.

4. **Installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
   - Download Visual Studio Code from the official [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Install the **C# extension** from the Extensions Marketplace to enable IntelliSense, debugging, and other features for C# development.

5. **Configuring the Development Environment**
   - Set up Visual Studio with necessary plugins and settings for optimal development.
   - Set up Visual Studio Code with the **C# extension** and **.NET Core CLI** integration for a streamlined experience.
   - Verify installation by running `dotnet --version` in the terminal to check the .NET Core SDK version.

#### **Basic Syntax and Structure of a C# Program (45 minutes)**

1. **Understanding the Structure of a C# Program**
   - Every C# program starts with a `using` directive, which is similar to an `import` in other languages.
   - The `namespace` keyword defines a scope that contains a set of related objects.
   - The `class` keyword is used to define a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects.
   - The `Main` method is the entry point of any C# application.
   - Example Structure of a Simple C# Program:

   ```csharp
   using System; // Importing the System namespace

   namespace HelloWorld // Defining a namespace
   {
       class Program // Defining a class named Program
       {
           // Main method: Entry point of the application
           static void Main(string[] args)
           {
               Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); // Output text to the console
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Key Components of the Program**
   - **Namespaces**: Organize code into logical groups and prevent naming conflicts.
   - **Classes and Objects**: Classes are templates for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.
   - **Main Method**: The starting point of the program, where execution begins.
   - **Statements**: Instructions that perform actions (e.g., `Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");`).
   - **Comments**: Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.

3. **Basic Syntax Elements in C#**
   - **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding value types (int, char, bool, etc.) and reference types (string, arrays, classes).
     - Example:

       ```csharp
       int age = 25; // Integer type
       string name = "John"; // String type
       bool isStudent = true; // Boolean type
       ```

   - **Operators**: Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), relational (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`), logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
     - Example:

       ```csharp
       int x = 10;
       int y = 20;
       int sum = x + y; // Addition operator
       ```

   - **Control Structures**: Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`), loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `foreach`).
     - Example:

       ```csharp
       if (age > 18)
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Adult");
       }
       else
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Minor");
       }
       ```

4. **Hands-On Exercise: Writing Your First C# Program (30 minutes)**
   - **Objective**: Write a simple console application that takes user input and displays a personalized message.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a new Console App project in Visual Studio or VS Code.
     2. Write code to prompt the user to enter their name.
     3. Read user input using `Console.ReadLine()`.
     4. Display a greeting message using `Console.WriteLine()`.
   - **Example Code**:

     ```csharp
     using System;

     namespace HelloWorld
     {
         class Program
         {
             static void Main(string[] args)
             {
                 Console.Write("Enter your name: "); // Prompt user for input
                 string name = Console.ReadLine(); // Read user input
                 Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to C# programming."); // Display output
             }
         }
     }
     ```
