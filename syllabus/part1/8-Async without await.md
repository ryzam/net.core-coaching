When a method is marked as `async` in C# and is called **without `await`**, it will still execute asynchronously. However, the caller will not wait for the completion of the asynchronous operation. Instead, it will continue executing the next line of code immediately after invoking the method. 

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **`async` Method without `await`:**
   - When you call an `async` method without `await`, the method starts executing up to the first `await` encountered inside it.
   - It returns a `Task` or `Task<T>` immediately to the caller without blocking the thread. The caller does not wait for the task to complete unless explicitly awaited later.
   - This means that the operation is still asynchronous, but the calling code is not waiting for it.

2. **Calling the Same `async` Method in Parallel:**
   - When you call an `async` method in parallel (e.g., using `Task.Run`, `Parallel.ForEach`, or creating multiple tasks), each invocation will execute independently and asynchronously.
   - If there is no `await` at the call site, the calls will return immediately, and the tasks will run concurrently. The method's asynchronous operation will proceed without blocking any thread.

3. **Does `async` Create a New Thread?**
   - **No, `async` itself does not create a new thread**. The `async` keyword allows the method to run asynchronously by utilizing the **current thread** and releasing it when awaiting an I/O-bound operation.
   - If you perform an **I/O-bound** operation (e.g., HTTP request, file read/write), the method will **not block** the calling thread, but it does not create a new thread.
   - If you perform a **CPU-bound** operation and explicitly use `Task.Run` or `Task.Factory.StartNew`, a new thread will be created from the **ThreadPool** to execute the CPU-bound code in parallel.

### **Example: Calling an `async` Method in Parallel Without `await`**

Consider the following example where we call an `async` method in parallel without using `await`:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class AsyncExample
{
    private static readonly HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();

    // An async method that fetches data from a URL
    public async Task<string> FetchDataAsync(string url)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Starting fetch from {url} on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
        
        // Simulate asynchronous I/O-bound operation
        HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.GetAsync(url);
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Completed fetch from {url} on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }

    public void RunParallelFetchWithoutAwait()
    {
        List<string> urls = new List<string>
        {
            "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1",
            "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2",
            "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3"
        };

        List<Task<string>> tasks = new List<Task<string>>();

        // Calling async method in parallel without awaiting
        foreach (var url in urls)
        {
            Task<string> fetchTask = FetchDataAsync(url);  // Call without await
            tasks.Add(fetchTask);  // Collect tasks
        }

        // Tasks are running concurrently; awaiting them to get results
        Task.WhenAll(tasks).Wait();  // Block here to wait for all tasks to complete

        Console.WriteLine("All tasks completed.");
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        AsyncExample example = new AsyncExample();
        example.RunParallelFetchWithoutAwait();
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **`FetchDataAsync` Method:**
   - This method is marked as `async` and fetches data from a URL asynchronously using `HttpClient`.
   - It prints a message before and after fetching the data to show which thread is executing.

2. **Calling `FetchDataAsync` Without `await`:**
   - The method `RunParallelFetchWithoutAwait` calls `FetchDataAsync` for each URL without using `await`.
   - Each call to `FetchDataAsync` starts an asynchronous operation but does not wait for it to complete. The tasks are added to a list to manage them later.

3. **Running Tasks in Parallel:**
   - The `Task.WhenAll(tasks).Wait()` is used to wait for all tasks to complete. This ensures that we wait until all fetch operations are done before printing "All tasks completed."

4. **Thread Usage and Concurrency:**
   - The output will show that each fetch operation is starting on the **same thread** (main thread), but they are all processed asynchronously. 
   - While the I/O operation (HTTP request) is ongoing, the thread is released to handle other operations.

### **What Happens When the Caller Invokes the Same Method in Parallel?**

- **When calling an `async` method multiple times in parallel without `await`**, each invocation will:
  - Start executing asynchronously up to the first `await`.
  - Return a `Task` immediately to the caller.
  - Perform its asynchronous operation (e.g., I/O-bound) without blocking the calling thread.

- **Does `async` Create a New Thread?**
  - **No**, `async` does not create a new thread. It allows the asynchronous operation to run without blocking the thread. If multiple calls are made to an `async` method in parallel, each call runs on the same thread or a different thread from the thread pool, depending on the context.
  - The **ThreadPool** may provide threads to handle asynchronous continuations after `await` if the original thread is busy with other tasks. 

### **Example: Calling the Same Method Using `Parallel.ForEach`**

Let's see an example where we explicitly call an `async` method using `Parallel.ForEach` to demonstrate concurrent execution:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ParallelAsyncExample
{
    private static readonly HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();

    public async Task<string> FetchDataAsync(string url)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Starting fetch from {url} on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
        HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.GetAsync(url);
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        Console.WriteLine($"Completed fetch from {url} on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }

    public void RunParallelAsyncCalls()
    {
        List<string> urls = new List<string>
        {
            "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1",
            "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2",
            "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3"
        };

        Parallel.ForEach(urls, async (url) =>
        {
            await FetchDataAsync(url);
        });
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ParallelAsyncExample example = new ParallelAsyncExample();
        example.RunParallelAsyncCalls();
        
        // Prevent the console app from closing immediately
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

#### **Explanation:**

1. **`Parallel.ForEach` Usage:**
   - `Parallel.ForEach` creates a loop that runs in parallel, invoking the `async` method `FetchDataAsync` for each URL.

2. **Async/Await in Parallel Loop:**
   - Even though `FetchDataAsync` is `async`, `Parallel.ForEach` itself is not asynchronous. It may use multiple threads from the **ThreadPool** for each iteration.
   - Each call to `FetchDataAsync` is awaited within the loop, which makes it asynchronous. This means the HTTP requests are performed concurrently.

3. **Thread Usage:**
   - Different threads may be used to handle each iteration of `Parallel.ForEach` depending on the ThreadPool's state and the number of cores available. 

### **Conclusion:**

- **`async`/`await` itself does not create new threads**; it allows asynchronous execution without blocking the thread.
- If you call an `async` method **without `await`**, it executes asynchronously, but the caller does not wait for it. If the caller invokes the method in parallel, it will run each invocation independently in parallel.
- To achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, you might need to use `Task.Run` or `Parallel.ForEach`, which will use multiple threads.
- For I/O-bound tasks, leveraging `async/await` effectively ensures high concurrency without the overhead of managing multiple threads manually.
