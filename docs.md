#### 5.4 Async/Await vs Concurrent Programming

The key differences between async/await and concurrent programming are:

1. Purpose:
   - Async/Await: Designed for I/O-bound operations to improve responsiveness.
   - Concurrent Programming: Designed for CPU-bound operations to improve performance through parallelism.

2. Thread Usage:
   - Async/Await: Generally doesn't create new threads, instead it efficiently uses existing threads.
   - Concurrent Programming: Often involves creating and managing multiple threads.

3. Complexity:
   - Async/Await: Simplifies asynchronous programming, making code more readable and maintainable.
   - Concurrent Programming: Can be more complex, requiring careful management of shared resources and synchronization.

#### 5.5 When to Use Each Approach

- Use Async/Await when:
  - Dealing with I/O-bound operations (file operations, network calls, database queries)
  - You want to keep the UI responsive in client applications
  - You're working with inherently asynchronous APIs

- Use Concurrent Programming when:
  - Performing CPU-intensive calculations
  - You need to utilize multiple cores for parallel processing
  - You're working with large datasets that can be processed independently
